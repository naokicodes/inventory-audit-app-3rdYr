# Dispatch queue — what to work on next

The ordered list of what's next. This replaces the local-only handoff
file, which lived on one machine and could not travel to a collaborator's
clone.

**Only an architect adds to this queue.** If it is empty, stop and wait.
See `docs/engineer-role.md`.

`docs/session-status.md` remains the authoritative description of each
step. This file says *what order* and *which lane* — not what the work
is. Read the step's own section in `session-status.md` before starting.

## Queue

### 1. Step 25a — commissary stock receipts (supplier intake)
**Lane: DISPATCH only. Needs an architect-written prompt.**

Not startable on engineer initiative. It adds a weight column alongside
`quantity` via a schema migration, which is red by default. The design is
already settled in `session-status.md` — what's missing is the prompt,
not the decision.

Spec: `session-status.md`, section "Steps 25a / 25b — the commissary
ledger has no way in".

### 2. Step 24b-v — the effective yield output must be kg-tracked
**Lane: DISPATCH only. Needs an architect-written prompt.**

A live data-corruption guard. It changes what the code rejects, which is
red by default. Must land before soft-launch.

Spec: `session-status.md`, section "Step 24b-v".

### 3. Nothing.
**This is deliberate. Do not invent a step 25.**

After 24b-v the plan is a soft launch against real output, so that actual
use decides what gets built next rather than guesswork. This is the same
reasoning that deferred the per-meat next-stage config. An idle assistant
costs far less than an invented step.

## Available engineer-lane work

These need no dispatched prompt and can be picked up on initiative. They
are genuinely useful and genuinely safe.

- **Browser click-through of Stock Receipts' Unallocated/Assign flow.**
  Owed and never done. Commissary's own Edit/Delete was click-tested
  during 24c-ii; this flow wasn't. No code change expected — open it,
  click through it, and report what you see. If you find a bug, open an
  issue rather than fixing it, since anything touching those filters is
  red.
- **Test coverage for behaviour that already exists and is correct.**
  Green by definition. Do not change the code to make a test pass — if
  the code seems wrong, that's an issue, not a fix.
- **Doc typos, dead links, stale file paths.** Green.

## Not in the queue, and not a task

- **The meat-type tagging pass on the LIVE database.** Live commissary
  meats have `meat_type_id` NULL, which is why every Allocate dropdown is
  empty. Step 25c fixes this for a freshly seeded DB, but it does not
  retro-tag existing rows and deliberately must not. Tagging an existing
  live DB is on-site data entry through the existing Settings UI, not a
  build task, and not a bug. Do not "fix" it in code.
- **Restaurant C (Likod) onboarding.** No workbook exists yet. Blocked on
  real-world data, not on code.
- **MySQL migration / POS integration.** Parked. Real work, not a config
  flip.
